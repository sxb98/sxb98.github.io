Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Xibin Sun 孙喜斌. I am a Ph.D. Student in the School of Government at Nanjing University. 

My research centers on the political psychology and behavior.

I obtained my M.A. degree from the School of Public Affiars at Xiamen University and a B.A. degree from the School of Public Administration at Central South University.

Since 2022, I have taken to Weibo (China’s Twitter) to introduce social science research from top academic journals. 

You can reach me via email: [sunxibinfinch@163.com].
